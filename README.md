# Harshvardhan Rathod (HAPPIOcrz007) — Code, Fintech, and a Dash of Ambition  

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where I turn caffeine, code, and curiosity into fintech solutions and real-deal projects. If you’re here looking for fluff, scroll on. I’m all about getting stuff done, leveling up, and stacking wins.

About Me
- B.Tech student @ MIT-WPU Pune — Electrical & Computer Engineering, but my heart beats for coding (and not just the basics)
- Started CS50 on 12th July; crushed Weeks 1-4 (only recover.c left to slay) - 
- Languages I speak fluently: C, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS — SQL is my current battle to conquer
- Linux user for years — command line? Terminal? Bring it on.
- Passionate about fintech, money management, and building projects that actually solve problems (and hopefully make some money)
- Reading list fueling my brain:
  - Algorithms to Live By — because smart code beats brute force
  - The Psychology of Money — understanding money is half the battle
  -(More books incoming as I devour knowledge)
